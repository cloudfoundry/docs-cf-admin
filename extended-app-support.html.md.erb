title: cflinuxfs3 Support Available through Extended App Support Tile
owner: Buildpacks
---


<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> 10.2.1+ supports running applications that use the cflinuxfs3 stack through a new Extended App Support tile. This capability is designed to help customers transition to 10.2 without needing to fully migrate all applications to cflinuxfs4.

This feature allows customers with remaining dependencies on cflinuxfs3 to continue using cflinuxfs3 with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> 10.2.1+, allowing time for a gradual migration strategy. It is especially useful for enterprises with complex upgrade planning, or where certain apps have not yet been validated against newer stacks.

## <a id="how-to"></a>Install and Set up the Tile

TAS for VMs 6.0.17 or later must be installed before you begin.

To enable cflinuxfs3 support in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> 10.2.1+, operators must:

1. Add the Extended App Support tile from the [Broadcom Support Portal](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=Extended%20App%20Support%20for%20Tanzu%20Platform).

1. In <%= vars.ops_manager_first %>, configure the Extended App Support tile:

    * **Network Configuration:** Configure the Network using **Assign AZs and Networks**. Choose the **Availability Zone** and **Network** for the temporary VM to run the install errand.
    * **Version Selection:** Select the cflinuxfs3-compatible buildpacks needed (e.g., Ruby, Java, Node.js). Any buildpacks that are not selected are uninstalled.
    * **Errands:** Configure Post-Deploy and Pre-Delete errands related to the buildpacks and stack.
    * **Resource Config:** Select the VM type to use for executing the errand.

1. Click **Apply Changes** to roll out the Extended App Support tile.

1. Once completed, navigate to the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, click on **Cloud Controller** section in the sidebar. Change **Available Stacks** to `cflinuxfs4 only`. [cflinuxfs4-only](./images/cflinuxfs3_upgrade.png)

1. **Apply Changes** to migrate to cflinuxfs3 provided by the Extended App Support tile.

1. Upgrade the foundation to 10.2.2 patch version or higher.

## <a id="notes"></a>Known Issues and Notes

   * The initial release of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> 10.2.0 does not support the new tile. Customers must upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> 10.2.1 or higher to use this functionality.
   * Buildpacks are no longer included with the platform by default and must be enabled via the tile, or added manually.
   * When applying changes, ensure that both <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and Extended App Support tile are selected for deployment.
   * If customers restage or push an app without installing the required buildpack(s), those operations fail.
   * Operators should carefully review buildpack selection in the tile to avoid unexpected restage issues.
   * Customers are still expected to fully migrate off cflinuxfs3 as soon as this is practical (end-of-support aligns with Tanzu Platform 6.X line), as this support tile is intended for transition use only.
   * If you uninstall the Extended App Support tile while still on TAS for VMs 6.0.x, unselect the errands on the delete to prevent deleting the buildpacks and deregistering the cflinuxfs3 stack.

## <a id="cli-support"></a>CLI Support

Customers can continue to use the [Stack Auditor cf CLI plug-in](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/tanzu-platform-for-cloud-foundry/10-3/tpcf/stack-auditor.html) to audit stack usage across their foundations and identify remaining cflinuxfs3 workloads that can now be supported in 10.2.1+ using this feature.
