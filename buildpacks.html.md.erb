<% end %>

You can manage additional buildpacks in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> by using the Tanzu cf CLI.

If your app uses a language or framework that the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>
(<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) system buildpacks do not support, you can take one of the following
actions:

* Write your own buildpack. For more information, see [Creating custom buildpacks](../buildpacks/custom.html).

* Customize an existing buildpack.

* Use a [Cloud Foundry Community Buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki/Buildpacks).

* Use a [Heroku Third-Party Buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/third-party-buildpacks).

## <a id="add"></a> Add a buildpack

<p> You must be a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> admin user to run the commands
discussed in this section.</p>

To add a buildpack:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf create-buildpack BUILDPACK PATH POSITION
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>BUILDPACK</code> specifies the buildpack name.</li>
      <li><code>PATH</code> specifies the location of the buildpack. <code>PATH</code> can point to a ZIP file, the URL of a ZIP file, or a local
      directory.</li>
      <li><code>POSITION</code> specifies where to place the buildpack in the detection priority list.</li>
    </ul>

    For more information, see [create-buildpack](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/create-buildpack.html) in the
    _Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide_.

1. To confirm that you have successfully added a buildpack, run:

    ```
    cf buildpacks
    ```

## <a id="rename"></a> Rename a buildpack

To rename a buildpack:

Using Tanzu cf CLI, run:

  ```
  cf update-buildpack --rename BUILDPACK-NAME NEW-BUILDPACK-NAME
  ```

  Where:
  <ul>
    <li><code>BUILDPACK-NAME</code> is the original buildpack name.</li>
    <li><code>NEW-BUILDPACK-NAME</code> is the new buildpack name.</li>
  </ul>

For more information about renaming buildpacks, see
[rename-buildpack](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/rename-buildpack.html) in the
_Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide_.

## <a id="update"></a> Update a buildpack

To update a buildpack, run:

```console
cf update-buildpack BUILDPACK [-p PATH] [-i POSITION] [-s STACK][--enable|--disable] [--lock|--unlock] [--rename NEW_NAME]
```

Where:

* `BUILDPACK` is the buildpack name.
* `PATH` is the location of the buildpack.
* `POSITION` is where the buildpack is in the detection priority list.
* `STACK` is the stack that the buildpack uses.

To rename the buildpack, use the <code>cf rename-buildpack</code> command.

For more information about updating buildpacks, see
[update buildpack](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/update-buildpack.html) in the
_Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide_.

## <a id="delete"></a> Delete a buildpack

To delete a buildpack, run:

```console
cf delete-buildpack BUILDPACK [-s STACK] [-f]
```

Where:

* `BUILDPACK` is the buildpack name.
* `STACK` is the stack that the buildpack uses.

For more information about deleting buildpacks, see
[delete-buildpack](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/delete-buildpack.html) in the
