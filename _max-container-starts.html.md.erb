If you are using a cloud-based IaaS, rather than a smaller on-premise solution, Cloud Foundry recommends leaving the default at `0`.

You can configure the maximum number of started instances by changing the `diego.auctioneer.starting_container_count_maximum` property in the Diego manifest.

1. Open the Diego manifest in a text editor.
1. Find the `diego.auctioneer.starting_container_count_maximum` property.
1. Set the maximum number of instances the auctioneer should allow to start.
1. Save the changes and redeploy BOSH.

For example, the following Diego manifest excerpt shows the `diego.auctioneer.starting_container_count_maximum` property set to `100`.

```
diego.auctioneer.starting_container_count_maximum:
    description: "Maximum number of inflight container starts allowed globally. Value of 0 or less indicates no limit."
    default: 100
```
