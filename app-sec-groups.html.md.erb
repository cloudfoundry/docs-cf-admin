## <a id='introduction'></a>Introduction ##

This topic describes how to use and administer Application Security Groups 
(ASG)s.

ASGs are a collection of egress rules that specify the protocols, ports, and IP address ranges where application containers (for either LRPs or tasks) send outbound traffic. Because ASGs define *allow* rules, their order of evaluation is unimportant when multiple ASGs apply to the same space, org, or deployment. Application containers use these rules to filter and log outbound network traffic.

When applications or tasks begin staging, they need traffic rules permissive enough to allow them to pull resources from the network. After an application or task is running, the traffic rules can be more restrictive and secure. To distinguish between these two security requirements, administrators can define one ASG for application and task staging, and another for application and task runtime. 

To provide granular control when securing a deployment, an administrator can assign ASGs to apply to all applications across a deployment, or to specific spaces or orgs within a deployment.

ASGs can be complicated to configure correctly, especially when the specific IPs listed in the group change. To simplify securing a deployment while still permitting apps to reach external services, operators can deploy the services into a subnet that is separate from their Cloud Foundry deployment. Then the operators can create ASGs for the apps that whitelist those service subnets, while denying access to any VMs hosting other apps.

For examples of typical ASGs, see the <a href="#typical-groups">Typical ASGs</a> section of this topic.

## <a id='default-asg'></a>Default ASGs ##

<% if vars.product_name == 'CF' %>
<%= partial 'default_asg_oss' %>
<% else %>
<%= partial '../opsguide/default_asg' %>
<% end %>

## <a id="asg-sets"></a> ASG Sets ##

An ASG set is a collection of ASGs that an administrator can apply to application containers. 

### <a id="default-set"></a> Default ASG Sets ###

All application containers in <%= vars.product_full %> use a default ASG set as a base policy.

<%= vars.product_full %> provides two default ASG sets:

* `default-staging`: This ASG set applies to application containers that are in the
staging application lifecycle phase. This includes both the buildpack staging
and Docker staging process. Typically, ASGs applied to staging application containers are more permissive to allow access to resources required for build and staging processes.
* `default-running`: This ASG set applies to application containers that are
started and running apps or tasks. Typically, ASGs applied to containers running apps and tasks are more restrictive.

### <a id="space-scoped"></a> Space-Scoped ASG Sets ###

In addition to the `default-staging` and `default-running` ASG sets, administrators can define additional ASGs and bind them to <%= vars.product_full %> [spaces](../concepts/roles.html#spaces). These ASGs are scoped to the space and are applied as a set to all application containers, either running or staging, in that space.

ASGs bound to spaces add network access only to the application containers within that space. 

In addition, space-scoped ASGs also apply to either staging tasks or running tasks.

Currently, <%= vars.product_full %> supports the use of space-scoped ASGs for staging application containers, however this is only supported via the CC API and not yet supported by the cf CLI. 

To apply staging-level network access to space-scoped ASGs, use the following CloudController (CC) API commands:

<pre>
GET /v2/security_groups/:guid/staging_spaces
PUT /v2/spaces/:guid/staging_security_groups/:security_group_guid data
PUT /v2/security_groups/:guid/staging_spaces/:space_guid
DELETE /v2/spaces/:guid/staging_security_groups/:security_group_guid  data
DELETE /v2/security_groups/:guid/staging_spaces/:space_guid
</pre>

These API calls require administrator access. 

Additionally, the payload returned from API `GET` calls to
`/v2/spaces/` and `/v2/spaces/:guid` includes a link to the 
`staging_security_groups_url`.

For more information on using these CC API commands, see the [Cloud Foundry API](https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/) documentation.

### <a id="asg-sets-applied"></a>How ASG Sets Are Applied ###

When <%= vars.product_full %> creates an application container, the egress rules for the application container include the following:

* All ASGs in either the `default-staging` or `default-running` set, depending on the staging or running state of LRP or task
* All ASGs bound to the space associated with the LRP or task, depending on the staging or running state of the LRP or task

## <a id='viewing'></a>Viewing ASGs ##

Run the following commands to view information about existing ASGs:

|Command                             |Output
|---                                 |---
|`cf security-groups`                |All security groups
|`cf staging-security-groups`        |All security groups in the `default-staging` set
|`cf running-security-groups`        |All security groups in the `default-running` set
|`cf security-group SG-NAME`         |All rules in the security group specified by `SG-NAME`

## <a id='creating-groups'></a>Creating ASGs ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: After creating an ASG, you must bind it for it to take effect. See the <a href="#binding-groups">Binding ASGs</a> section of this topic for more information.</p>

ASG rules are specified as a JSON array of ASG objects. An ASG object has the following attributes:

Follow the instructions in the sections below to create [individual ASGs](#asg-individual) and [baseline ASGs](#asg-baseline).

###<a id='asg-individual'></a>Create Individual ASGs

To create individual ASGs, perform the following steps:

1. Create a **rules** file: a JSON-formatted single array containing objects that describe the rules. Refer to the example below, which allows ICMP traffic of code `1` and type `0` to all destinations, and TCP traffic to `10.0.11.0/24` on ports `80` and `443`:

    <pre>
    [
      {
        "protocol": "icmp",
        "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
        "type": 0,
        "code": 1
      },
      {
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "destination": "10.0.11.0/24",
        "ports": "80,443",
        "log": true<%= vars.appsecgroupdesc1 %> 
      }
    ]
    </pre>

1. Run the following [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) (cf CLI) command, replacing 
`SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group, and `PATH-TO-RULES-FILE` 
with the absolute or relative path to a rules file.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-security-group SECURITY-GROUP PATH-TO-RULES-FILE
</pre>

1. <a href="#binding-groups">Bind the ASG</a>.

###<a id='asg-baseline'></a>Create Baseline ASGs

ASG Creator is a CLI tool to generate baseline ASGs that introduce a list of network access
rules for all application containers. You can use this baseline ASG prevent access to specific networks and individual IP addresses. The ASG rules files generated by ASG Creator contain those IP 
address ranges that application containers are allowed access to. 

To use ASG Creator to create baseline ASGs, perform the following steps:

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/asg-creator/releases/latest) of ASG Creator.
1. Create a configuration file named `config.yml` that contains the networks and IP addresses you want to blacklist. Follow the format of the example below, and consult the table for descriptions of the attributes.

    ```yaml
    excluded_ips:
    - 192.0.2.4

    excluded_networks:
    - 192.0.2.0/24
    ```

    |Attribute|Description
    |---|---
    |excluded_ips|An array of IP addresses to exclude. ASG Creator omits these addresses from the baseline ASG rules.
    |excluded_networks|An array of CIDRs to exclude. ASG Creator omits all IP addresses in these networks from the baseline ASG rules.

1. Run `asg-creator create`, supplying the `config.yml`, to create the
baseline ASG rules files **public-networks.json** and **private-networks.json**.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ asg-creator create --config config.yml
    Wrote public-networks.json
    Wrote private-networks.json
    OK
    </pre>

    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not supply a configuration file, ASG Creator only excludes <code>169.254.169.254</code> from <code>public-networks.json</code>.

1. Review the generated ASG rules files, **public-networks.json** and **private-networks.json**, and make changes in accordance with your network policy for application containers running untrusted code.

1. Run the following cf CLI commands with the ASG rules files to create baseline staging and running ASGs:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf create-security-group YOUR-PRIVATE-NETWORKS-SECURITY-GROUP private-networks.json
    $ cf bind-staging-security-group YOUR-PRIVATE-NETWORKS-SECURITY-GROUP 
    $ cf bind-running-security-group YOUR-PRIVATE-NETWORKS-SECURITY-GROUP 

    $ cf create-security-group YOUR-PUBLIC-NETWORKS-SECURITY-GROUP public-networks.json
    $ cf bind-staging-security-group YOUR-PUBLIC-NETWORKS-SECURITY-GROUP 
    $ cf bind-running-security-group YOUR-PUBLIC-NETWORKS-SECURITY-GROUP 
    </pre>

## <a id='updating-groups'></a>Updating ASGs ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Updating an ASG does not affect started applications until you restart them. To restart all of the applications in an org or a space, use the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/app-restarter">app-restarter</a> cf CLI plugin.</p>

To update an existing ASG, run the following command, replacing `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group, and `PATH-TO-RULES-FILE` with the absolute or relative path to a rules file.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf update-security-group SECURITY-GROUP PATH-TO-RULES-FILE
</pre>

## <a id='binding-groups'></a>Binding ASGs ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Binding an ASG does not affect started applications until you restart them. To restart all of the applications in an org or a space, use the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/app-restarter">app-restarter</a> cf CLI plugin.</p>

To apply an ASG to application containers, you must first bind it to a default set or a space.

To bind an ASG to the `default-staging` set, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-staging-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To bind an ASG to the `default-running` set, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-running-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To bind an ASG to a specific space, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG SPACE
</pre>

To bind an ASG to all of an organization’s existing spaces, run the command below. The `cf bind-security-group` command requires cf CLI 6.20.0 or higher.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG
</pre>

## <a id='unbinding-groups'></a>Unbinding ASGs ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Unbinding an ASG does not affect started applications until you restart them. To restart all of the applications in an org or a space, use the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/app-restarter">app-restarter</a> cf CLI plugin.</p>

To unbind an ASG from the `default-staging` set, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-staging-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To unbind an ASG from the `default-running` set, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-running-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To unbind an ASG from a specific space, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG SPACE
</pre>

## <a id='deleting-groups'></a>Deleting ASGs ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: You can only delete unbound ASGs. To unbind ASGs, see the <a href="#unbinding-groups">Unbinding ASGs</a> section of this topic.</p>

To delete an ASG, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

## <a id='typical-groups'></a>Typical ASGs ##

Below are examples of typical ASGs. Configure your ASGs in accordance with your organization's network access policy for untrusted applications.

|ASG                   |For access to
|---                   |---
|`dns`                 |DNS, either public or private
|`public-networks`     |Public networks, excluding IaaS metadata endpoints
|`private-networks`    |Private networks in accordane with  [RFC-1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918#section-3)
|`load-balancers`      |The internal <%= vars.product_full %> load balancer and others
|`internal-proxies`    |Internal proxies
|`internal-databases`  |Internal databases

### <a id='dns-example'></a>DNS ###

In order to resolve hostnames to IP addresses, applications require DNS server 
connectivity, which typically use port 53. Administrators should create or
update a `dns` ASG with appropriate rules. Administrators may further restrict
the DNS servers to specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses.

Example `dns` ASG:

```
[
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
    "ports": "53"
  },
  {
    "protocol": "udp",
    "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
    "ports": "53"
  }
]
```

### <a id='public-networks-example'></a>Public Networks ###

Applications often require public network connectivity to retrieve application dependencies, or to integrate with services available on public networks. Example application dependencies include public Maven repositories, NPM, RubyGems, and Docker registries.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: You should exclude IaaS metadata endpoints, such as <code>169.254.169.254</code>, because the metadata endpoint can expose sensitive environment information to untrusted applications. The <code>public_networks</code> example below accounts for this recommendation.</p>

Example `public_networks` ASG:

```
[
  {
    "destination": "0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "11.0.0.0-169.253.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "169.255.0.0-172.15.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  }
]
```

### <a id='private-networks-example'></a>Private Networks ###

Network connections that are commonly allowable in private networks include
endpoints such as proxy servers, Docker registries, load balancers, databases,
messaging servers, directory servers, and file servers. Configure appropriate
private network ASGs as appropriate. It may be helpful to use a naming
convention with `private_networks` as part of the ASG name, such as `private_networks_databases`.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Be sure to exclude any private networks and IP addresses that application containers should not have access to. </p>

Example `private_networks` ASG:

```
[
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255",
    "ports": "443"
  },
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255",
    "ports": "443"
  },
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255",
    "ports": "443"
  }
]
```
### <a id='marketplace-services'></a>Marketplace Services ###

Each installed Marketplace Service requires its own set of ASG rules to
function properly. Refer to the installation instructions for each
installed Marketplace Service to determine which ASG rules it requires. See the [Services Overview](../devguide/services/) topic for more information about how to provision and integrate services.
