title: Using the Stack Auditor Plug-In
owner: Buildpacks
---

Stack Auditor is a cf CLI plug-in that provides commands for listing apps and their stacks, migrating apps to a new stack, and deleting a stack.

For example, a typical use for Stack Auditor is migrating a large number of apps to a new stack.
This includes moving apps from `cflinuxfs3` to `cflinuxfs4` in preparation to upgrade your deployment
to a version that does not contain `cflinuxfs3`.
The following table describes the workflow you can use:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Stage</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>Operator audits stack usage to determine which apps need to be migrated. See <a href="#list-stacks">List Apps and Their Stacks</a>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>Operator communicates with developers that they must migrate their existing apps to a new stack and begin pushing all new apps to the new stack.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>Developers migrate their apps to the new stack. See <a href="#change-stacks">Change Stacks</a>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>Operator confirms apps have been migrated.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>5</td>
		<td>Operator deletes buildpacks associated with the old stack.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>6</td>
		<td>Operator deletes the old stack. See <a href="#delete-stacks">Delete a Stack</a>.
		<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you upgrade your deployment to a version that contains the stack you deleted, the stack returns on upgrade.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>7</td>
		<td>If applicable, operator upgrades the deployment to the version that does not contain the old stack.</td>
	</tr>

	```

## <a id="use"></a> Using Stack Auditor

The following sections describe how to use Stack Auditor.

### <a id="list-stacks"></a> List Apps and Their Stacks

With Stack Auditor, you can get a list of the apps in each org and space and see what stack they are using.

To see which apps are using which stack, run the following command. The output lists apps for each org you have access to. To see all the apps in your deployment, be sure to log in to the cf CLI as a user who can access all orgs.

```
cf audit-stack
```

Here is example output:

  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf audit-stack
  first-org/development/first-app cflinuxfs3
  first-org/staging/first-app cflinuxfs3
  first-org/production/first-app cflinuxfs3
  second-org/development/second-app cflinuxfs4
  second-org/staging/second-app cflinuxfs4
  second-org/production/second-app cflinuxfs4
  ...
  </pre>

### <a id="change-stacks"></a> Change Stacks for a Single App

Stack Auditor allows you to change the stack that an app uses. Stack Auditor rebuilds the app onto the new stack without a change in the source code of the app. If you want to move the app to a new stack with updated source code, follow the procedure in [Changing Stacks](../devguide/deploy-apps/stacks.html).

To change the stack an app uses:

1. Target the org and space of the app:

	```
	cf target -o ORG -s SPACE
	```

    Where:

    <ul>
      <li><code>ORG</code> is the org the app is in.</li>
      <li><code>SPACE</code> is the space the app is in.</li>
    </ul>

1. Run the following command:

	```
	cf change-stack APP-NAME STACK-NAME
	```

    Where:

    <ul>
      <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the app that you want to move to a new stack.</li>
      <li><code>STACK-NAME</code> is the stack you want to move the app to.</li>
    </ul>

	Here is example output:

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf change-stack my-app cflinuxfs4
	Attempting to change stack to cflinuxfs4 for my-app...
	Starting app my-app in org pivotal-pubtools / space pivotalcf-staging as ljarzynski@pivotal.io...

	Application my-app was successfully changed to Stack cflinuxfs4
	</pre>

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the app is in a <code>stopped</code> state, it remains stopped after changing stacks. Also, when attempting to change stacks, your app is stopped. If the app fails on <code>cflinuxfs4</code>, Stack Auditor attempts to restage your app on <code>cflinuxfs3</code>.</p>

### <a id="change-stacks-all-apps"></a> Change Stacks for All Apps in a Space

Stack Auditor also allows you to migrate all apps in a space to a new stack. For example, using jq you can write a script to find all apps in a space and migrate them to cflinuxfs4:

```jq
cf audit-stack --json | jq -r 'map(select(.stack == "cflinuxfs3")) | .[] |"cf target -o \(.org) -s \(.space) && cf change-stack \(.name) cflinuxfs4"' | xargs -i{} bash -c {}
```

### <a id="delete-stacks"></a> Delete a Stack

Stack Auditor allows you to delete a stack from your deployment. You must be an admin user to delete a stack.

1. To delete a stack, run the following command. This action cannot be undone, with the following exception: If you upgrade your deployment to a version that contains the stack you deleted, the stack returns on upgrade.

	```
	cf delete-stack STACK-NAME
	```
	Where `STACK-NAME` is the name of the stack you want to delete.

  Here is example output:

	<pre class="terminal">
    $ cf delete-stack cflinuxfs3
    Are you sure you want to remove the cflinuxfs3 stack? If so, type the name of the stack [cflinuxfs3]
    >cflinuxfs3
    Deleting stack cflinuxfs3...
    Stack cflinuxfs3 has been deleted.
    </pre>

    If you have any apps still running on `cflinuxfs3`, the command returns the following error:

    <pre class="terminal">
    Failed to delete stack cflinuxfs3 with error: Please delete the app associations for your stack.
    </pre>

### <a id="contact-users"></a> Contacting Users of Apps

If you are having problems with an app and need help, you can use the cf CLI to get a list of email addresses of users in a space. For example, run:

```
cf space-users ORG-NAME SPACE-NAME
```

Where:

  * `ORG-NAME` is the org the app is in.
  * `SPACE-NAME` is the space the app is in.

## <a id="known-issues"></a> Known Issues

The following are known issues with changing stacks from cflinuxfs3 to cflinuxfs4.

### <a id="ruby-buildpack"></a> Ruby Buildpack 3.1 or Later Is Required

Ruby 3.1 or later is required for the Ruby buildpack running on cflinuxfs4. Upgrade your application to work with Ruby 3.1 or later by specifying it in your application's Gemfile and working through any issues that result. If an application specifies a version of Ruby in its Gemfile not included in the buildpack, it results in the following error message:

<pre class="terminal">
**ERROR** Unable to determine ruby: Unable to determine ruby version: Running ruby: No Matching versions, ruby = 2.7.6 not found in this buildpack                                                                ·······
Failed to compile droplet: Failed to run all supply scripts: exit status 15
</pre>

This happens because Ruby v2.7 and v3.0 are incompatible with OpenSSL3, which is the version of OpenSSL in cflinuxfs4.

### <a id="openssl1.1"></a> OpenSSL1.1 Is Not Included in cflinuxfs4

cflinuxfs4 does not include OpenSSL1.1. If your application depends on OpenSSL1.1, like a static file buildpack containing an executable but using the system libraries for SSL, it will fail to run. Ensure that your application can be rebuilt against OpenSSL3 or include the OpenSSL1.1 libraries with your application.
