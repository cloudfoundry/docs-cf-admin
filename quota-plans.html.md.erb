You can use quota plans in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, including creating and modifying quota plans for orgs and spaces.

## <a id='quota-plans-overview'></a>Quota plans overview

Quota plans are named sets of memory, service, log rate, and instance usage quotas. For example, one quota plan might allow up to 10 services, 10 routes,
2&nbsp;GB of RAM, and 2&nbsp;KB of generated logs, while another might offer 100 services, 100 routes, 10&nbsp;GB of RAM, and 16&nbsp;KB of generated logs.
Quota plans have user-friendly names, but are referenced in <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> internal systems by unique GUIDs.

Quota plans are not directly associated with user accounts. Instead, every org has a list of available quota plans, and the account admin assigns a specific
quota plan from the list to the org. Everyone in the org shares the quotas described by the plan. There is no limit to the number of defined quota plans an
account can have, but only one plan can be assigned at a time.

You must set a quota plan for an org, but you can choose whether to set a space quota. For more information, see the [Orgs](../concepts/roles.html#orgs) and
[Spaces](../concepts/roles.html#spaces) sections of the _Orgs, Spaces, Roles, and Permissions_ topic.

For information about managing network policy quotas, see [Manage Network Policy Quotas](../devguide/deploy-apps/cf-networking.html#policy-quotas) in
_Configuring Container-to-Container Networking_.

## <a id='default-org-plan'></a> Default quota plan for an org

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> installs with a quota plan named `default` with the following values:

* Memory limit: `10240 MB`

* Total routes: `1000`

* Total services: `100`

* Non-basic aervices allowed: `true`

* Trial DB allowed: `true`

* Log rate limit: `unlimited`

<% if vars.platform_code == 'CF' %>
## <a id='new-org-plan'></a> Create a quota plan for an org

<p> The org manager sets and manages quotas. For more information, see <a href="../concepts/roles.html">Orgs, Spaces,
  Roles, and Permissions</a>.</p>

You must create an org quota plan. You can create a quota plan for an org in one of following ways:

* Directly modify the manifest for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment before deploying. For more information, see [Create a Quota Plan for an Org
Through the Deployment Manifest](#new-edit-manifest).

* Create an org quota plan through the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) after deploying. For more information, see [Create a Quota Plan for an
Org Through the cf CLI](#create-org-quota).

### <a id='new-edit-manifest'></a> Create a quota plan for an org through the deployment manifest

The manifest for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment specifies the default quota plans applied to orgs. You can modify the default quota plans by
locating and editing the manifest.

To modify the deployment manifest:

1. In a text editor, open the deployment manifest YAML file.

1. Search for `quota_definitions`.

1. Add a new quota definition with values that you specify. Use the default quota definition as a formatting template. The following example shows the
`quota_definitions` portion of the `cf.yml` manifest after adding the `silver_quota` plan:

    ```
    quota_definitions:
           default:
              memory_limit: 1024M
              log_rate_limit: 8K
              non_basic_services_allowed: true
              total_routes: 1000
              total_services: 100
              trial_db_allowed: true
            silver_quota:
              memory_limit: 2048M
              log_rate_limit: 16K
              non_basic_services_allowed: true
              total_routes: 500
              total_services: 25
              trial_db_allowed: true
    ```

1. Save and close the deployment manifest.

1. Apply the deployment manifest by running:

    ```
    bosh -e ENV -d DEPLOYMENT deploy MANIFEST.yml
    ```
    Where:
    * `ENV` is your BOSH Director alias.
    * `DEPLOYMENT` is the name of your deployment.
    * `MANIFEST` is the filename of the deployment manifest.

<p> Any subsequent updates to the quota in the manifest are not applied to your environment after the initial deploy, even
  though BOSH updates the Cloud Controller instance with new settings.</p>

## <a id='new-org-plan'></a> Creating a quota plan for an org

<p> The org manager sets and manages quotas. For more information, see <a href="../concepts/roles.html">Orgs, Spaces,
  Roles, and Permissions</a>.</p>

You must create a quota plan for the org. To create a new quota plan for org, see [Create a Quota Plan for an Org Through the cf CLI](#create-org-quota).
<% end %>

### <a id='create-org-quota'></a> Creating a quota plan for an org through the cf CLI

To create a new quota plan for an org through the cf CLI:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf create-org-quota QUOTA-NAME -m TOTAL-MEMORY -i INSTANCE-MEMORY -l LOG-RATE-LIMIT -r NUMBER-OF-ROUTES -s NUMBER-OF-SERVICE-INSTANCES
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>QUOTA-NAME</code> is the name you want to give the quota plan.</li>
      <li><code>TOTAL-MEMORY</code> is the total amount of memory you want to allocate to all app instances in the org.</li>
      <li><code>INSTANCE-MEMORY</code> is the maximum amount of memory an app instance can use. Specify <code>-1</code> to allow app instances to use an unlimited amount of memory.</li>
      <li><code>LOG-RATE-LIMIT</code> is the total number of logs per second you want to allow all app instances in the org to send to Loggregator.</li>
      <li><code>NUMBER-OF-ROUTES</code> is the total number of routes you want to allow all app instances in the org.</li>
      <li><code>NUMBER-OF-SERVICE-INSTANCES</code> is the total number of service instances you want to allow all app instances in the org.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Include the <code>--allow-paid-service-plans</code> flag to allow the quota plan to provision instances of paid service plans.</li>
    </ul>

    For example:

    ```
    cf create-org-quota small -m 2048M -i 1024M -l 2K -r 10 -s 10 --allow-paid-service-plans
    ```

1. Record the name of the quota plan you want to modify.

1. Run:

    ```
    cf update-org-quota QUOTA-NAME -n NEW-QUOTA-NAME -m TOTAL-MEMORY -i INSTANCE-MEMORY -r NUMBER-OF-ROUTES -s NUMBER-OF-SERVICE-INSTANCES
    ```
    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>QUOTA-NAME</code> is the name of the quota plan you want to modify.</li>
      <li>(Optional) <code>NEW-QUOTA-NAME</code> is the new name you want to give the quota plan.</li>
      <li>(Optional) <code>TOTAL-MEMORY</code> is the total amount of memory you want to allocate to all app instances in the org.</li>

      <li>(Optional) <code>NUMBER-OF-SERVICE-INSTANCES</code> is the total number of service instances you want to allow all app instances in the org.</li>
      <li>(Optional) To allow the quota plan to provision instances of paid service plans, include the <code>--allow-paid-service-plans</code> flag. To prevent the quota
      plan from provisioning instances of paid service plans, include the <code>--disallow-paid-service-plans</code> flag.</li>
    </ul>

    For example:

    ```
    cf update-org-quota small -n medium -m 4096M -i 2048M -l 8K -r 20 -s 20 --allow-paid-service-plans
    ```


## <a id='set-org-quota'></a> Assign a quota plan to an org

To assign a quota plan to an org:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf set-org-quota ORG QUOTA-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>ORG</code> is the name of the org to which you want to assign the quota plan.</li>
      <li><code>QUOTA-NAME</code> is the name of the quota plan you want to assign to the org.</li>
    </ul>


## <a id='space'></a> Create and modify quota plans for a space

For each org, Org Managers create and modify quota plans for spaces in the org. If an Org Manager allocates a space quota, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
verifies that resources do not exceed the allocated space limit. For example, when a Space Developer deploys an app, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> first checks
the memory allocation at the space level, then at the org level.

To create a quota plan for an individual space within an org, see [Create a Quota Plan for a Space](#new-space-plan).

To modify a quota plan for an individual space within an org, see [Modify a Quota Plan for a Space](#modify-space-plan).

### <a id='new-space-plan'></a> Creating a quota plan for a space

To create a quota plan for an individual space within an org:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf create-space-quota QUOTA-NAME -m TOTAL-MEMORY -i INSTANCE-MEMORY -l LOG-RATE-LIMIT -r NUMBER-OF-ROUTES -s NUMBER-OF-SERVICE-INSTANCES
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>TOTAL-MEMORY</code> is the total amount of memory you want to allocate to all app instances in the space.</li>
      <li><code>INSTANCE-MEMORY</code> is the maximum amount of memory an app instance can use. Specify <code>-1</code> to allow app instances to use an unlimited amount of memory.</li>
      <li><code>LOG-RATE-LIMIT</code> is the total number of logs per second you want to allow all app instances in the org to send to Loggregator.</li>
      <li><code>NUMBER-OF-ROUTES</code> is the total number of routes you want to allow all app instances in the space.</li>

      <li>(Optional) Include the <code>--allow-paid-service-plans</code> flag to allow the quota plan to provision instances of paid service plans.</li>
    </ul>

    For example:

    ```
    cf create-space-quota big -m 4096M -i 1024M -l 16K -r 20 -s 20 --allow-paid-service-plans
    ```

### <a id='modify-space-plan'></a> Modifying a quota plan for a space

To modify a quota plan for an individual space within an org:

1. View all existing quota plans for all of the spaces in your org by running:

    ```
    cf space-quotas

    </pre>

1. Record the name of the quota plan you want to modify.

1. Run:

    ```
    cf update-space-quota QUOTA-NAME -n NEW-QUOTA-NAME -m TOTAL-MEMORY -i INSTANCE-MEMORY -r NUMBER-OF-ROUTES -s NUMBER-OF-SERVICE-INSTANCES
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>QUOTA-NAME</code> is the name of the quota plan you want to modify.</li>
      <li>(Optional) <code>NEW-QUOTA-NAME</code> is the new name you want to give the quota plan.</li>
      <li>(Optional) <code>TOTAL-MEMORY</code> is the total amount of memory you want to allocate to all app instances in the space.</li>
      <li>(Optional) <code>INSTANCE-MEMORY</code> is the maximum amount of memory an app instance can use. Specify <code>-1</code> to allow app instances to use an unlimited amount of
      memory.</li>
      <li>(Optional) <code>LOG-RATE-LIMIT</code> is the total number of logs per second you want to allow all app instances in the org to send to Loggregator.</li>
      <li>(Optional) <code>NUMBER-OF-ROUTES</code> is the total number of routes you want to allow all app instances in the space.</li>
      <li>(Optional) <code>NUMBER-OF-SERVICE-INSTANCES</code> is the total number of service instances you want to allow all app instances in the space.</li>
      <li>
        (Optional) To allow the quota plan to provision instances of paid service plans, include the <code>--allow-paid-service-plans</code> flag. To prevent the quota
        plan from provisioning instances of paid service plans, include the <code>--disallow-paid-service-plans</code> flag.
      </li>
    </ul>

    For example:

    ```
    cf update-space-quota big -n bigger -m 4096M -i 20 -l 32K -r 20 -s 20 --allow-paid-service-plans
    ```


## <a id='set-space-quota'></a> Assign a quota plan to a space

To assign a quota to a space, run the following command. Replace the placeholder attributes with the values for this quota plan:

To assign a quota plan to a space:

1. In a terminal window, run:

    ```
    cf set-space-quota SPACE QUOTA-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>SPACE</code> is the name of the space to which you want to assign the quota plan.</li>
      <li><code>QUOTA-NAME</code> is the name of the quota plan you want to assign to the space.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note important">
    If you attempt to assign a quota plan with a log rate limit to a space containing apps that are already configured to
    send an unlimited number of logs to Loggregator, the command returns an error. To remedy this issue, see
    <a href="#update-log-rate-limit">Configure apps with unlimited Log Rate Limits</a>.
    </p>

### <a id='update-log-rate-limit'></a> Configure apps with unlimited log rate limits

If you assign a quota plan with a log rate limit to a space containing apps that are already configured to send an unlimited number of logs to Loggregator,
you see an error similar to the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
Setting space quota big to space example-space as admin...
Current usage exceeds new quota values. The space(s) being assigned this quota contain apps running with an unlimited log rate limit.
FAILED
</pre>

Before you can assign a quota plan to the space, you must configure each app in the space with a log rate limit that is lower than the log rate limit
specified in the quota plan.

To update the log rate limit for an app in the space to which you want to assign a quota plan:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf scale -l LOG-RATE-LIMIT APP-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>LOG-RATE-LIMIT</code> is the log rate limit in bytes per second that you want to configure for the app.</li>
      <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the name of the app for which you want to configure a log rate limit.</li>
    </ul>

After you have configured a log rate limit for each app in the space, follow the procedure in [Assign a Quota Plan to a Space](#set-space-quota).
