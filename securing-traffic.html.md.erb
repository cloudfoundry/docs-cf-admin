<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the options for securing HTTP traffic into your <%=vars.product_full%> <%=vars.product_abbr%> deployment with SSL/TLS certificates. You can configure the location where your deployment terminates TLS depending on your needs and certificate restrictions.

<%=vars.ssl_config%>

## <a id="protocol_support"></a>Protocol Support

Gorouter supports HTTP/HTTPS requests only. For more information about features supported by the Gorouter, see the [HTTP Routing](../concepts/http-routing.html) topic.

To secure non-HTTP traffic over TCP Routing, terminate TLS at your load balancer or at the application. See [TCP Routing](enabling-tcp-routing.html) for details.

##<a id="ssl_options"></a>SSL/TLS Termination Options for HTTP Routing

There are several options for terminating SSL/TLS for HTTP traffic. You can terminate TLS at the Gorouter, your load balancer, or at both. 

The following table summarizes SSL/TLS termination options and which option to choose for your deployment.

## <a id="certtypes"></a> Certificate Requirements

The following requirements apply to the certificates you use to secure traffic into <%=vars.product_short%><span>:</span>

* You must obtain at least one SSL/TLS certificate for your environment. 
  * In a production environment, use a signed SSL/TLS certificate (trusted) from a known certificate authority (CA).
  * In a development or testing environment, you can use a trusted CA certificate or a self-signed certificate. You can generate a self-signed certificate with `openssl` or a similar tool. 
  <%=vars.ssl_cert_ert%>
* Certificates used in CF must be encoded in the PEM format. 
<%=vars.gorouter_sni%>
* The Gorouter supports mutual TLS, and validates a client provided certificate chain against its CA certificates if one is provided in the TLS handshake, but does not require it. Depending on whether you choose to terminate at both the Load Balancer and Gorouter, or at Gorouter alone, the client certificate may be that of the load balancer or of the originating client.
* The certificate on the Gorouter must be associated with the correct hostname so that HTTPS can validate the request.
* If wildcard certificates are not supported for some or all of your domains, then configure termination requests at the [load balancer only](#lb_term). In this type of deployment, the load balancer passes unencrypted traffic to the Gorouter. As a result, you avoid having to reissue and reinstall certificates on the Gorouter for every app or UAA security zone.
* Extended Validation (EV) certificates support multiple hostnames, like SAN, but do not support wildcards. As Gorouter has not been tested with EV certificates, if EV certificates are required, then terminate TLS/SSL at the [load balancer only](#lb_term). 

## <a id="ciphers"></a> TLS Cipher Suite Support

Some CF components like Gorouter support additional TLS cipher suites to accommodate older clients. As a security best practice, only configure the TLS cipher suites that you need for your deployment.

### <a id="default"></a> Default Gorouter Cipher Suites

By default Gorouter supports the following TLS cipher suites, both of which require TLS v1.2:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>RFC</th>
    <th>OpenSSL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</td>
    <td>ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</td>
    <td>ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<%= vars.cipher_suites %>

#### <a id="aws_elbs"></a> TLS Cipher Suite Support by AWS Load Balancers

AWS Classic Load Balancers (formerly referred to as ELBs) support configuration of cipher suites for front-end connections with clients only. When configuring Classic Load Balancers to forward requests to Gorouters over TLS, operators may encounter a "Cipher Suite Mismatch" error. This is because the cipher suites supported by Classic Load Balancers for TLS handshakes with backends (Gorouters in this case) are hardcoded, undocumented, and do not support the Gorouter default cipher suites. 

Operators have three options:

- Configure Classic Load Balancer listeners in TCP mode so that TCP connections from clients are passed through the Classic Load Balancer to Gorouters on port 443. Then Gorouters are the first point of TLS termination. This option is the recommended solution.
- If you require TLS termination at an AWS load balancer in addition to terminating at Gorouter, use [AWS Application Load Balancers (ALBs)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) that support the Gorouter default cipher suites.
- Configure Gorouter to support an older TLS version (v1.1 or v1.0) and then configure any of the TLS v1.0 or v1.1 cipher suites listed below in addition to the defaults. This option is the least secure option and should be used only if you are required to use an AWS Classic Load Balancer and also require TLS termination at both the load balancer and the Gorouter.<br/><br/>
    <%= partial vars.aws_lb_cipher_suites %><br/>
    Since this option relies on using an older cipher suite, consult your security team before implementing this solution.

### <a id="tls_1.2"></a> TLS v1.2

The following cipher suites are optionally supported for TLS v1.2 only:

See [Golang Constants](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.7/src/crypto/tls/cipher_suites.go#L269-L285) and [OpenSSL Cipher Suites](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/apps/ciphers.html) for more information about supported ciphers.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: ECDSA ciphers require a certificate and key for DSA, as opposed to RSA.</p>

##<a id="gorouter_term"></a>Terminating SSL/TLS at the Gorouter Only

In this configuration, the load balancer does not terminate TLS for CF domains at all. Instead, it passes through the underlying TCP connection to the Gorouter.

This option is the recommended and more performant option, establishing and terminating a single TLS connection.

The following diagram illustrates communication between the client, load balancer, Gorouter, and app.

<%= image_tag("pass-through.png") %>

Traffic between the load balancer and the Gorouter is encrypted only if the client request is encrypted.

### <a id="cert_guidelines_gorouter"></a>Certificate Guidelines

* The Gorouter currently supports configuring multiple HTTPS certificates using the `router.tls_pem` property.
* Use of Subject Alternative Names is recommended because <%=vars.product_short%> requires wildcard domains.

### <a id="http_header_gorouter"></a>About HTTP Header Forwarding

If you terminate TLS/SSL at the Gorouter only, your load balancer does not send HTTP headers.

The Gorouter appends the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers to requests forwarded to applications and platform system components. `X-Forwarded-For` is set to the IP address of the source. Depending on the behavior of your load balancer, this may be the IP address of your load balancer. For Gorouter to deliver the IP address of the client to applications, configure your load balancer to forward the IP address of the client or configure your load balancer to send the client IP address using the PROXY protocol. Gorouter will set `X-Forwarded-Proto` to the scheme of the client request.

For more information on HTTP headers in CF, see [HTTP Headers](../concepts/http-routing.html##http-headers). If you are configuring the forwarding of client certificates, see [Forward Client Certificate to Applications](../concepts/http-routing.html#forward-client-cert).

### <a id="pass-through"></a>Procedure: Gorouter Only

<% if vars.product_name == 'CF' %>
<%= partial 'ssl_termin_gorouter_oss' %>
<% else %>
<%= partial '../opsguide/ssl_termin_gorouter_pcf' %>
<% end %>

##<a id="lb_term"></a> Terminating SSL/TLS at the Load Balancer Only

In this configuration, your load balancer terminates TLS, and passes unencrypted traffic to the Gorouter, which routes it to your app. Traffic between the load balancer and the Gorouter is not encrypted.

This option is recommended if you cannot use SAN certificates and if you do not require traffic to be encrypted between the load balancer and the Gorouter.

The following diagram illustrates communication between the client, load balancer, Gorouter and app.

<%= image_tag("lb.png") %>

### <a id="cert_guidelines_lb"></a> Certificate Guidelines

You can use multiple certificates on your load balancer if the load balancer supports multiple VIPs or SNI.

### <a id="http_header_lb"></a> About HTTP Header Forwarding

If you terminate SSL/TLS at your load balancer, then you must also configure the load balancer to append the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` HTTP headers to the HTTP traffic it passes to the Gorouter.

For more information on HTTP headers in CF, see [HTTP Headers](../concepts/http-routing.html##http-headers). If you are configuring the forwarding of client certificates, see [Forward Client Certificate to Applications](../concepts/http-routing.html#forward-client-cert).

### <a id="lb"></a> Procedure: Load Balancer Only

<% if vars.product_name == 'CF' %>
<%= partial 'ssl_termin_lb_only_oss' %>
<% else %>
<%= partial '../opsguide/ssl_termin_lb_only_pcf' %>
<% end %>

##<a id="lb_and_gorouter_term"></a>Terminating SSL/TLS at the Load Balancer and Gorouter

In this configuration two TLS connections are established: one from the client to the load balancer, and another from the load balancer to the Gorouter. This configuration secures all traffic between the load balancer and the Gorouter.

The following diagram illustrates communication between the client, load balancer, Gorouter, and app.

<%= image_tag("lb-and-router.png") %>

This option is less performant, but allows for termination at a load balancer,  as well as secure traffic between the load balancer and Gorouter. 

### <a id="cert_guidelines_lb_gorouter"></a> Certificate Guidelines

In this deployment scenario, the following guidelines apply:

- Certificates for the <%=vars.product_short%> domains must be stored on the load balancer, as well as on Gorouter.
- Generate certificates for your load balancer and Gorouter with different keys. If the key for the certificate on the Gorouter is compromised, then the certificate on the load balancer is not at risk, and vice versa.
- Configure your load balancer with the CA and hostname with which to validate the certificate hosted by the Gorouter.

### <a id="hostname_verfication"></a> About Hostname Verification

Hostname verification between the load balancer and Gorouter is unnecessary when the load balancer is already configured with the Gorouter's IP address to correctly route the request.

If the load balancer uses DNS resolution to route requests to the Gorouters, then you should enable hostname verification.

### <a id="http_header_lb_gorouter"></a> About HTTP Header Forwarding

If you terminate SSL/TLS at your load balancer, then you must configure the load balancer to append the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` HTTP headers to requests it sends to the Gorouter.

If you terminate SSL/TLS at your load balancer but it does not support HTTP, such that it cannot append HTTP headers, a workaround exists. We recommend you use this workaround **only if your load balancer does not accept unencrypted requests**. Configure your load balancer to send the client IP address using the PROXY protocol, and enable PROXY in Gorouter. As the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header will not be present, configure Gorouter to force-set this header to 'HTTPS'. 

For more information on HTTP headers in CF, see [HTTP Headers](../concepts/http-routing.html##http-headers). If you are configuring the forwarding of client certificates, see [Forward Client Certificate to Applications](../concepts/http-routing.html#forward-client-cert).

### <a id="lb-and-router"></a> Procedure: Load Balancer and Gorouter

<% if vars.product_name == 'CF' %>
<%= partial 'ssl_termin_gorouter_lb_oss' %>
<% else %>
<%= partial '../opsguide/ssl_termin_gorouter_lb_pcf' %>
<% end %>

##<a id="sni"></a> Support for SNI

Gorouter's `router.tls_pem` property enables support for SNI which allows operators to configure Gorouter with multiple certificates. This property replaces `router.ssl_key` and `router.ssl_cert` which were previously required to terminate SSL/TLS.

The `router.tls_pem` property supports both RSA and ECDSA certificates in PEM
encoding. This property is an array where each entry is a combination of
private key and certificate. In the case that a certificate chain is required,
the order should be as follows: primary certificate, intermediate certificate, then root certificate. The private key can be either appended or prepended.

```

The first certificate listed acts as the default certificate. This has the equivalent behavior as the previous property `router.ssl_cert` and `router.ssl_key`.

When TLS is enabled in Gorouter, the behavior is as follows:

- If a client provides an SNI header with a ServerName that matches to a certificate in `router.tls_pem`, Gorouter will return the matching certificate
- If a client provides an SNI header with a ServerName that does not match to a certificate in `router.tls_pem`, Gorouter will return the default certificate
- If a client does not provide an SNI header and the requested hostname matches to a certificate in `router.tls_pem`, Gorouter will return the matching certificate.
- If a client does not provide an SNI header and requested hostname does not match to a certificate in `router.tls_pem`, Gorouter will return the default certificate.
