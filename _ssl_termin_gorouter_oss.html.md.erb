To enable this configuration, perform the following steps:

1. Configure your load balancer to pass through requests from the client to the Gorouter.
1. Insert the certificate into your deployment manifest for the Gorouter:
    1. Use `bosh edit deployment` to open your release manifest for editing.
    1. Copy the contents of your certificate file and the private key file associated with your certificate into the `properties.router.tls_pem` field. Set `enable_ssl` to `true`.

        ```
        properties:
          router:
            tls_pem:
            - |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              SSL_CERTIFICATE_SIGNED_BY_PRIVATE_KEY
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
              -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
              RSA_PRIVATE_KEY
              -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            enable_ssl: true
        ```
