With <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, you can set feature flags by using the cf CLI to activate or deactivate the features available to users.


## <a id='flag-commands'></a> View and edit feature flags

To perform the following procedures, you must be logged in to your deployment as an admin using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

To view and edit feature flags:

1. Use the `cf feature-flags` command to list the feature flags:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf feature-flags

    Features                                      State
    user_org_creation                             disabled
    private_domain_creation                       enabled
    app_bits_upload                               enabled
    app_scaling                                   enabled
    route_creation                                enabled
    service_instance_creation                     enabled
    diego_docker                                  disabled
    set_roles_by_username                         enabled
    unset_roles_by_username                       enabled
    task_creation                                 enabled
    env_var_visibility                            enabled
    space_scoped_private_broker_creation          enabled
    space_developer_env_var_visibility            enabled
    service_instance_sharing                      disabled
    hide_marketplace_from_unauthenticated_users   disabled
    resource_matching                             enabled
    </pre>
    <br>
    For descriptions of the features enabled by each feature flag, see [Feature Flags](#flags).

1. To view the status of a feature flag, run:

    ```
    cf feature-flag FEATURE-FLAG-NAME
    ```
    Where `FEATURE-FLAG-NAME` is the name of the feature flag you want to view.

1. To enable a feature flag, run:

    ```
    cf enable-feature-flag FEATURE-FLAG-NAME
    ```
    Where `FEATURE-FLAG-NAME` is the name of the feature flag you want to activate.

1. To deactivate a feature flag, run:

    ```
    cf disable-feature-flag FEATURE-FLAG-NAME
    ```
    Where `FEATURE-FLAG-NAME` is the name of the feature flag you want to deactivate.


## <a id='flags'></a> Feature flags

Only admins can set feature flags. All flags are activated by default except `user_org_creation` and `diego_docker`. When deactivated, these features are only available to admins.

The following list provides descriptions of the features enabled or deactivate by each flag, and the minimum Cloud Controller API (CC API) version necessary to use the feature. <%= vars.api_version %>:

* `user_org_creation`: Any user can create an org. <%= vars.user_org_creation %> Minimum CC API version: 2.12.

* `private_domain_creation`: An Org Manager can create private domains for that org. Minimum CC API version: 2.12.

* `app_bits_upload`: Space Developers can upload app bits. Minimum CC API version: 2.12.

* `app_scaling`: Space Developers can perform scaling operations such as changing memory, disk, or instances. Minimum CC API version: 2.12.

* `route_creation`: Space Developers can create routes in a space. Minimum CC API version: 2.12.

* `route_sharing`: Space Developers can share routes between two spaces (including across orgs) in which they have the Space Developer role. When deactivated, Space Developers cannot share routes between two spaces. Minimum CC API version: 3.117.

* `service_instance_creation`: Space Developers can create service instances in a space. Minimum CC API version: 2.12.

* `diego_docker`: Space Developers can push Docker apps. Minimum CC API version 2.33.

* `set_roles_by_username`: Org Managers and Space Managers can add roles by username. Minimum CC API version: 2.37.

* `unset_roles_by_username`: Org Managers and Space Managers can remove roles by username. Minimum CC API version: 2.37.

* `task_creation`: Space Developers can create tasks on their app. Minimum CC API version: 2.47.

* `env_var_visibility`: Admins can view environment variables. Minimum CC API version: 2.58.

* `space_scoped_private_broker_creation`: Space Developers can create space-scoped private service brokers. Minimum CC API version: 2.58.

* `space_developer_env_var_visibility`: Space Developers can view their v2 environment variables. Space Developers and Space Supporters can view their v3 environment variables. Minimum CC API version: 2.58.

* `service_instance_sharing`: Space Developers can share service instances between two spaces (across orgs) in which they have the Space Developer role.

* `hide_marketplace_from_unauthenticated_users`: Do not allow unauthenticated users to see the service offerings available in the marketplace.

* `resource_matching`: Allow the package upload endpoint to cache uploaded packages for resource matching. When deactivated, the resource match endpoint always returns an empty array of matches. Minimum CC API version: 3.77.
