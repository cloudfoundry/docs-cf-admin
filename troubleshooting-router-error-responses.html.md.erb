This topic helps operators to better understand if 502's are a result of the <%= vars.product_full %> Platform or an application.

## <a id="points-of-failure"></a> Points of Failure

There are different points of failure in which 502's can come from:

1. Infrastructure
    - Load Balancer
    - Network
2. Platform - <%= vars.product_name %>
    - Gorouter
    - Diego Cell(s)
3. Application

In the **Infrastructure**, 502's can occur in the following way:

- From the Load Balancer, 502's can surface when the Gorouters are not receiving traffic at all.
    - This can be observed if the Load Balancer is logging 502's but the Gorouters are not.

In the **Platform**, 502's can occur in the following ways:

- If the Gorouter is unable to connect to the application container:
    - TCP dial issues (can't make an initial connection to the [backend](../concepts/http-routing.html#back-end)). The Gorouter will retry TCP dial errors up to three times, if it still fails then a 502 will be returned to the client and logged to the `access.log`. This may be due to:
		- An application that is unresponsive (which indicates an issue with the application)
		- The Gorouter has a stale route (which indicates an issue with the platform)
		- The application container is corrupted (which indicates a problem with the platform)
		- These types of errors may look like this within the `gorouter.log`:
    <pre class="terminal">
    [2018-07-05 17:59:10+0000] {"log_level":3,"timestamp":1530813550.92134,"message":
    "backend-endpoint-failed","source":"vcap.gorouter","data":{"route-endpoint":
    {"ApplicationId":"","Addr":"10.0.32.15:60099","Tags":null,"RouteServiceUrl":""},
    "error":"dial tcp 10.0.32.15:60099: getsockopt: connection refused"}}
    </pre>
- If the Gorouter successfully dials the endpoint but an error occurs:
    - `read: connection reset by peer` errors can occur when the application closes the connection abruptly with a TCP RST packet and not the expected FIN-ACK. This will cause the Gorouter to retry the next endpoint. Note, Gorouter does not currently retry on `write: connection reset by peer` failures.
    - TLS Handshake errors. When these errors occur, the Gorouter will retry up to three times and if it's still failing then a 502 may be returned. These errors appear similar to the following in the `gorouter.log` (and a 502 will be logged in the `access.log`):
    <pre class="terminal">
		[2018-07-05 18:20:54+0000] {"log_level":3,"timestamp":1530814854.4359834,"message":"
    backend-endpoint-failed","source":"vcap.gorouter","data":{"route-endpoint":
    {"ApplicationId":"","Addr":"10.0.16.17:61002","Tags":null,"RouteServiceUrl":""},
    "error":"x509:certificate is valid for 53079ca3-c4fe-4910-78b9-c1a6, not xxx"}}
    </pre>
    - If the Gorouter successfully connects to the endpoint, but an error occurs while the request is in transport (i.e. Gorouter has not received a response from the endpoint):
    - Prior to <%= vars.routing_version %>, there was a bug that logged a 502 for requests canceled by clients before the server responded with headers. <%= vars.routing_version %> and beyond, if the same situation occurs, a 499 is returned.

In an **Application**, 502's can occur in the following ways (Note: the Gorouter will not retry any error response that is returned by the application):

- If 502's are only occuring from a particular application instance(s) and not all of the applications on the  platform, then it is likely an application-related error (i.e. application is overloaded, unresponsive, can't connect to database, etc.).
- If all applications are experiencing 502's, then it could either be a platform issue (possible misconfiguration) or an application issue (i.e. all applications are unable to connect to an upstream database).

## <a id="debugging-steps"></a> General Debugging Steps

Here are general debugging steps for any issue resulting with 502 error codes:

- Gather the Gorouter logs & Diego Cell logs at the time of the incident. <%= vars.gather_routing_logs %>
- Review the logs and consider the following questions:
    1. Which errors are the Gorouters returning?
    2. Is the Gorouter's [routing table](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter#dynamic-routing-table) accurate (are the endpoints for the route as expected)?
    3. Do the Diego Cell logs have anything interesting about unexpected app crashes and/or restarts?
    4. Is the application healthy and handling requests successfully? (try using [request tracing headers](../concepts/http-routing.html#zipkin-headers) to verify)
- Was there a recent platform change/upgrade that caused an increase in 502's?
- Are there any suspicious [metrics](<%= vars.gorouter_metrics_link %>) spiking? How is CPU & Memory utilzation?

## <a id="gorouter-error-classification"></a>Gorouter Error Classification Table

Error Type | Status Code | Source of Issue | Evidence
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Dial | 502 | Application or Platform | logs with error `dial tcp`
ConnectionResetOnRead | 502 | Application or Platform | logs with error `read: connection reset by peer`
AttemptedTLSWith<br/>NonTLSBackend | 525 | Platform* | - logs with error `tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake`<br/> - `backend_tls_handshake_failed` metric increments
HostnameMismatch | 503 | Platform | - logs with error `x509: certificate is valid for <x> not <y>`<br/> - `backend_invalid_id` metric increments
UntrustedCert | 526 | Platform | - logs with an error prefix `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`<br/> - `backend_invalid_tls_cert` metric increments
RemoteFailedCertCheck | 496 | Platform | logs with error remote `error: tls: bad certificate`
ContextCancelled | 499 | Client/App | logs with error `context canceled`
RemoteHandshakeFailure | 525 | Platform | - logs with error remote `error: tls: handshake failure`<br/> - `backend_tls_handshake_failed` metric increments
*Note: any platform issue could be the result of a misconfiguration

For each of the above errors, there will be a `backend-endpoint-failure` log line in `gorouter.log` and an error message in `gorouter.err.log`. Additionally, the [`access.log`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter#logs) will record the request status codes.
