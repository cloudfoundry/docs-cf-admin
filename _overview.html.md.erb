To watch an overview of the topic, see [CPU Entitlements in Cloud
Foundry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV87xmxKLeA) on YouTube.

CPU entitlement describes the percentage of host CPU a particular app instance
is _entitled_ to use. Apps have a CPU performance of less than 100% when
their usage is less than their entitlement and greater than 100% when they are
bursting above their entitlement. Apps are always guarunteed 100% of their CPU
entitlement. When possible apps can "burst" and use more than 100% of their
entitlement. Bursting capability depends on the conditions on the VM and how
much CPU other processes are using.

In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, apps have CPU entitlements that are
proportional to their allocated memory by default. For example, an app with
access to 256MB of memory on a 512MB machine has access to half of the
memory on the machine and is also entitled to half of the CPU of that machine.
