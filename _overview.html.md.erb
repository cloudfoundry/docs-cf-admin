To watch an overview of the topic, see [CPU Entitlements in Cloud
Foundry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV87xmxKLeA) on YouTube.

CPU entitlement describes the percentage of host CPU a particular app instance
is _entitled_ to use. The CPU entitlement plug-in shows that apps have a CPU
performance of 100% when they are using exactly the CPU they are entitled. Apps
have a CPU performance of less than 100% when their usage is less than their
entitlement and greater than 100% when they are above their entitlement.

In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, apps have CPU entitlements that are
proportional to their allocated memory by default. For example, an app with
access to 256MB of memory on a 512MB machine has access to half of the
memory on the machine and is also entitled to half of the CPU of that machine.
