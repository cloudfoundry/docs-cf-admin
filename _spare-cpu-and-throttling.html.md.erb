If there are three cores on the Diego Cell to which your app is deployed, 300%
CPU can be distributed between all the apps on the Diego Cell. This is the
percentage that the `cf app` command displays. The metrics depend on factors
such as the capacity of the Diego Cell and the total number of apps on it that
are not visible to the user. This can make it difficult for users and operators
to balance CPU resources.

An app always receives 100% of its CPU entitlement, no matter what other apps
are on the Diego Cell. If there are spare resources on the machine, an app can
consume over 100% CPU.
