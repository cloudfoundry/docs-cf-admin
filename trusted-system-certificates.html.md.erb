title: Configuring Trusted System Certificates for Applications
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

There are two different mechanisms to provide trusted certificates to applications running on Cloud Foundry:

1. For the `cflinuxfs2` stack, the trusted certificates may be installed directly into the system trust store at `/etc/ssl/certs`. In the deployment manifest, set the `cflinuxfs2-rootfs.trusted_certs` property of the `cflinuxfs2` release's `cflinuxfs2-rootfs-setup` job to the concatenated values of the PEM-encoded CA certificates. For example:
    <pre><code>
    properties:
      cflinuxfs2-rootfs:
        trusted_certs: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          (contents of certificate #1)
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          (contents of certificate #2)
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    </code></pre>

2. Additionally, trusted certificates may be presented to all application instances, including those based on Docker images and those on Windows. To do so, provide the concatenated PEM-encoded CA certificates in the `diego.rep.trusted_certs` BOSH property (on both the Diego release's `rep` and `rep_windows` jobs or in the global properties in the deployment manifest). The individual certificates in this property will appear as separate files in the `/etc/cf-system-certificates` directory. For example:
    <pre><code>
    properties:
      diego:
        rep:
          trusted_certs: |
            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            (contents of certificate #1)
            -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            (contents of certificate #2)
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    </code></pre>
