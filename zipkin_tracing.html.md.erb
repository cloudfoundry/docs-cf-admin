Zipkin is a tracing system that enables app developers to troubleshoot failures or latency issues. Zipkin provides the ability to trace requests and responses across distributed systems. For more information, see [Zipkin.io](http://zipkin.io/).

<%= partial vars.zipkin_enable %>

For more information about how the Gorouter works with HTTP headers and Zipkin tracing, see the [HTTP Headers](../concepts/http-routing.html#http-headers) section of the _HTTP Routing_ topic.

To trace app requests and responses in <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>), apps must also log Zipkin headers.   

After adding Zipkin HTTP headers to app logs, developers can use `cf logs myapp` to correlate the trace and span IDs logged by the Gorouter with the trace IDs logged by their app. To correlate trace IDs for a request through multiple apps, each app must forward appropriate values for the headers with requests to other apps.
